## RadioHub

RadioHub is a web application I created a few years ago while learning to program. The project aimed to build a simple interface for playing online radio stations. I used front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, and the Bootstrap framework to ensure responsiveness and an aesthetically pleasing design.

### **Features**
- **Play radio stations**: Add radio station URLs to stream audio directly.
- **Responsive design**: The app works seamlessly on various devices thanks to Bootstrap.
- **Interactive elements**: jQuery enabled dynamic DOM manipulation and event handling.

---

### **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: Page structure (approximately 64% of the project's code).
- **CSS**: Styling and visual customization (approximately 6% of the project's code).
- **Javascript**: Handling user interactions and dynamic updates (approximately 27% of the project's code).
- **Bootstrap**: Framework for responsive layouts (approximately 3% of the project's code).

### **How to Run the Project**
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### **Summary**
RadioHub was an important milestone in my programming journey, allowing me to apply front-end technologies in a practical way. The project showcases my early experiences with dynamic web applications.
The code is poorly structured, resembling "spaghetti code," and contains an excessive number of imports. As a result, it feels highly outdated when compared to modern JavaScript frameworks or even clean, well-written plain JavaScript.

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the project, feel free to reach out!
